# Battery Safety Monitoring Logic

## Overview
0. The firmware shall continuously monitor battery temperature and current using integrated sensors.
1. The software shall implement algorithms to detect abnormal battery conditions (e.g., overtemperature, overcurrent, rapid voltage drop).
2. The system shall log all detected events and trigger user notifications for critical conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
0. Firmware receives and processes sensor data in real time.
1. Fault detection algorithms are validated against simulated battery fault scenarios.
2. All critical events are logged and user notifications are generated.

## Rationale
0. Software logic is essential for real-time detection and response to battery safety issues.
