# Firmware Specification for Battery Safety Monitoring

## Overview

0. The firmware shall support real-time acquisition of battery temperature, current, and voltage data.
1. Fault detection algorithms shall be implemented to identify unsafe battery conditions and sensor failures.
2. The firmware shall trigger protective actions and log all relevant events.

## Data Acquisition Requirements

0. The firmware shall interface with temperature, current, and voltage sensors.
1. Data shall be sampled at a configurable rate to ensure timely detection of unsafe conditions.
2. All sensor data shall be stored in a circular buffer for diagnostics.

## Fault Detection and Protection Logic

0. The firmware shall compare sensor readings to predefined safe thresholds.
1. If unsafe conditions are detected, the firmware shall disconnect the battery and log the event.
2. The firmware shall support automatic recovery and user notification.

## Logging and Reporting

0. All abnormal events and faults shall be logged with timestamps and relevant sensor data.
1. Logs shall be accessible via the device interface for regulatory and diagnostic purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria

0. The firmware reliably detects and responds to unsafe battery conditions.
1. All features are validated through test protocols and documented results.

## Rationale

0. Firmware-based monitoring and protection are essential for proactive battery safety management in medical devices.
