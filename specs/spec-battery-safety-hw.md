# Battery Safety Hardware Enhancements

## Overview
0. The power supply subsystem shall integrate temperature sensors for real-time battery monitoring.
1. The subsystem shall include improved overcurrent protection circuitry.
2. The enclosure shall be modified as needed to accommodate new components.

## Acceptance Criteria
0. Temperature sensors are installed and provide continuous data to the control system.
1. Overcurrent protection circuitry is validated through hardware testing.
2. Enclosure modifications maintain IP67 rating and mechanical integrity.

## Rationale
0. Hardware enhancements are necessary to support advanced battery safety features and regulatory compliance.
