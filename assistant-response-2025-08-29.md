I'll help you understand how to create a project and connect it to Jira in Ketryx.Based on the documentation, here's how to create a project and connect it to Jira in Ketryx:

## Creating a Project and Connecting to Jira

**Prerequisites:**
- Administrative privileges on your Jira organization
- "Manage connections" permission in Ketryx (typically for organization owners)
- The Jira project must be created **first** as a **Company-Managed** project (not Team-Managed)

**Setup Process:**

1. **Install the Ketryx Connector:**
   - Log into Ketryx
   - In Jira, install the [Ketryx Connector for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228398/ketryx-connector-for-jira) from the Atlassian Marketplace
   - Complete installation by pressing "Get started" and "Complete installation in Ketryx"
   - In Ketryx, confirm the connection by pressing "Connect Jira organization"

2. **Create Your Ketryx Project:**
   - Once the Jira-Ketryx connection is established, create your Ketryx project
   - During project creation, select your existing Jira project from the dropdown menu
   - This automatically configures the Jira project with Ketryx's issue types, screens, and workflows

**Important Notes:**
- Each Jira instance connects to only one Ketryx organization
- Each Jira project connects to only one Ketryx project (and vice versa)
- You **cannot** connect a Jira project to an existing Ketryx project - the connection must be made during Ketryx project creation
- If you create a Ketryx project without Jira connection, you'd need to delete it and recreate to add Jira integration

The integration provides deep synchronization between Ketryx and Jira, maintaining proper electronic records and enhancing Jira with traceability widgets and approval workflows aligned with standards like ISO 13485 and IEC 62304.
