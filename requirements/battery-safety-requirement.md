# Advanced Battery Safety Monitoring and Protection

## Overview

0. The system shall implement advanced battery safety features in the power supply and battery management subsystem.
1. This requirement derives from the Enhanced Battery Safety Features Change Request (KXREC07NWD6C5F98MBSERJ39NTYHGVN).
2. The system shall support real-time temperature monitoring, improved overcurrent protection, and enhanced fault detection algorithms.

## Monitoring Requirements

0. The system shall continuously monitor battery temperature using integrated sensors.
1. The system shall monitor battery current and voltage in real time.
2. The system shall log all abnormal readings for traceability and diagnostics.

## Protection Requirements

0. The system shall trigger protective actions if temperature, current, or voltage exceed safe thresholds.
1. Overcurrent protection shall disconnect the battery from the load if unsafe conditions are detected.
2. The system shall support automatic recovery after safe conditions are restored.

## Fault Detection Requirements

0. The system shall detect and report battery faults, including sensor failures and abnormal readings.
1. Fault detection algorithms shall be implemented in firmware and tested for reliability.
2. All detected faults shall be logged and reported to the user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

0. The system reliably detects and responds to unsafe battery conditions in real time.
1. All monitoring and protection features are validated through test cases and documented results.
2. Fault events are logged and accessible for post-event analysis.

## Rationale

0. Enhanced battery safety features reduce the risk of hazardous situations such as thermal runaway, fire, or device shutdown due to battery faults.
1. Real-time monitoring and protection improve user safety and device reliability.
