# Enhanced Battery Safety Management

## Overview
0. The system shall implement real-time battery temperature monitoring, overcurrent protection, and advanced fault detection algorithms.
1. The system shall log all battery safety events and provide user notifications for critical conditions.
2. The system shall support hardware integration of temperature sensors and protection circuitry.

## Acceptance Criteria
0. Real-time temperature monitoring is active during all operational states.
1. Overcurrent protection triggers safe shutdown and user alert.
2. Fault detection algorithms identify abnormal battery behavior and log events.
3. All safety events are accessible via the user interface and remote monitoring application.

## Rationale
0. Proactive battery safety management reduces risk of hazardous events.
1. Compliance with industry best practices and regulatory standards.
